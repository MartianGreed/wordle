# STEP 05

## Attempts
Now that we can create game we a user connects his wallet, we can start playing around.

When we access UI, we will fetch user attempts to display previous tries.

When a user submits an attempt, we will apply logic to display hints and adds to attempts list.

- start by creating action in `useSystemCalls.ts`
- bind action in `components/wordle.tsx` on form submit
